JobFinder

In this application i have used to read an external URL to fetch the data from this URL to the mobile application which is called 
JobFinder.
Totally it can preview any data you required from this URL.
i have used JSONArray to fetch the data and JSONObject to control each object inside the array. (Object Consist of multiple fields).
while you are searching for the jobs, you will have for each Job Description a URL which it's Hyperlinked and will redirect you to the Job you have seen if you press on it. 
Scroll View in order to fetch all the data and to be seenable in the mobile application from the URL you wan. (unbounded)
it may have some enhancments in future, for the way it's previewed.
